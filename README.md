### Challenges:

This was my very first independent full stack application in addition to my first React and React Native app.

Communication between users was a challenge because there was no direct link. Instead all the users talked to the database to gather information on the others. My solution was adding a refresh option that could allow for retrieval of updated information. An alternative solution would be to use a socket connect like firebase to have data relayed to the user without the need of continuous api calls.
